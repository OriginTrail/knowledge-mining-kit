# Knowledge Mining Kit - Coming soon!

Knowledge Mining Kit is a comprehensive set of tools and tutorials tailored for knowledge miners.

The Knowledge Mining Kit will be rolled out as part of **Genesis Knowledge Mining** beta program, which will be performed only on OriginTrail Parachain (NeuroWeb).

The initial beta Knowledge Mining will be facilitated by OriginTrail Core developers and all interested knowledge miners can participate by using the Knowledge Mining Kit. The aim of the beta program is to validate the intended approach in a simplified manner (MVP approach) so that improvements and potential flaws can be discovered in a timely manner.

There are 4 general steps in the Knowledge Mining cycle:
- **Discovery**: To establish dynamic cycles and quick iterations, the genesis Knowledge Mining beta program will have a narrow focus on two specific knowledge domains:
  - Knowledge about the wider OriginTrail ecosystem (AI, knowledge graph and blockchain technologies, and their relation to OriginTrail)
  - Knowledge relevant for the construction industry
  - Details of how discovery can be done, and the specifics on the two knowledge domain topics will be presented in the Knowledge Mining kit.
- **Publishing**: Several tools and instructions will be provided for creation and publishing of Knowledge Assets in the Knowledge Mining Kit, and will gradually expand over the course of the beta program. 
- **Enrichment**: Will focus on connecting relevant Knowledge Assets (linking signal) and token locking (economic signal).
- **Learning**: Initially the learning step will be performed by OriginTrail Core developers, introducing mined Knowledge Assets into OriginTrail World.

All details of the process, including how you can participate will be explained in the Knowledge Mining Kit. A total of 1.000.000 OTP tokens (to become Neuro tokens) will be designated for the Knowledge Mining Beta program rewards.
